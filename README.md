## Building the site 🏗

You'll need a recent version of Node: v12.10 or higher.

### Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/StefanZoneExamples/nextauthjs.git
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm ci
```

### Start a local server to preview the site

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000/` to see the site locally. Changes to assets will
rebuild the site. Refresh to see your changes.

## Deploying the site 🚀

The site will build and deploy the `main` branch automatically after every `git push origin main` via [Netlify](https://netlify.com).
